### JLCPCB

[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=see) has always been my go-to for 3D printing and PCB manufacturing. They also provided the keyboard plate, 3D printed case, and PCB for this project. If you're looking to build your own board, I highly recommend their services.

### Beekeeb

The folks at [beekeeb](https://shop.beekeeb.com) were super nice and provided the switches and keycaps for this project. I haven't bought anything from them yet, but I've only heard good things from the community. If you're looking for keyboard kits/prebuilts/parts, definitely check them out!
